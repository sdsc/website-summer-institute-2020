The San Diego Supercomputer Center Summer Institute is a week-long workshop held at the University of California, San Diego that focuses on a broad spectrum of introductory-to-intermediate topics in **High Performance Computing and Data Science**. The program is aimed at researchers in academia and industry, especially in domains not traditionally engaged in supercomputing, who have problems that cannot typically be solved using local computing resources. This year’s Summer Institute continues SDSC’s strategy of bringing **High Performance Computing to the Long Tail of Science**, i.e. providing resources to a larger number of modest-sized computational research projects that represent, in aggregate, a tremendous amount of scientific progress.

Researchers and educators from underrepresented groups and minority serving institutions (MSIs) are strongly encouraged to apply. We also encourage applications from XSEDE Campus Champions (link to https://www.xsede.org/community-engagement/campus-champions)

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to give the attendees an overview of topics in High Performance Computing and Data Science and accelerate their learning process through **highly interactive classes** with **hands-on tutorials** on the Comet Supercomputer.

The program includes:

* Insights on how to use Comet, including interacting with the job scheduler, understanding strengths and weaknesses of the available filesystems and using Singularity containers to run another Operating System like Ubuntu.
* Traditional supercomputing topics such as parallel programming with MPI/OpenMP, performance optimization, code profiling, GPU programming with CUDA and scientific visualization.
* Modern Data Science topics like Machine Learning, Big Data processing with Spark and parallel programming with Python.
* Topics related to reproducibility such as basic and advanced version control with git/GitHub and workflow management with Kepler.
* An introduction to SDSC’s newest resource, <i>Expanse</i>, which is scheduled to go into production in October 2020. The emphasis will be on <i>Expanse’s</i>unique features and on porting applications from <i>Comet</i>.

Moreover the attendees will have many opportunities to **meet one-on-one with SDSC's experts** to discuss in detail the best techniques to solve their specific scientific problems.
In order to benefit from the classes, the attendees are required to have familiarity with the UNIX/Linux shell. Basic programming skills (in any programming language) are strongly recommended.

The registration fee has been reduced to $100 and will be charged only after the application has been accepted. See [application page](/apply) for **deadlines**.
