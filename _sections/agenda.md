|**AM Session <br/> <br/>8 AM- 10:45 AM** <br/><br/>*15 min- Break will be based on instructor* | **Python for HPC** <br/> _Andrea Zonca, Senior Computational Scientist, SDSC_ <br/> In this session we will introduce four key technologies in the Python ecosystem that provide significant benefits for scientific applications run in supercomputing environments. Previous Python experience is recommended but not required. <br/> (1) The Jupyter Notebook allows users to execute code on a single compute node through a local browser for interactive data exploration and visualization. The Jupyter Notebook supports live Python code, explanatory text, LaTeX equations and plots in the same document. (2) IPython Parallel provides a simple, flexible and scalable way of running thousands of Python serial jobs by spawning IPython kernels (namely engines) on any HPC batch scheduler. (3) Numba makes it possible to run pure Python code on GPUs simply by decorating functions with the data types of the input and output arguments. <br/> Pure Python prototype code can be gradually optimized by pushing the most computationally intensive functions to the GPU without the need to implement code in CUDA or OpenCL. (4) Dask is a flexible parallel computing library that allows to build a distributed computation using simple operators and then let the library automatically handle distributing data, executing the computation hierarchically and gather back the results.  | **A Short Introduction to Data Science and its Applications** <br/> _Subhasis Dasgupta, Computational and Data Researcher, SDSC_ <br/> _Shweta Purawat, Computational and Data Researcher, SDSC_ <br/> _Ilya Zaslavsky, Dr. Spatial Information Systems Lab, SDSC_ <br/> The new era of data science is here. Our lives as well as any field of science, engineering, business and society are continuously transformed by our ability to collect meaningful data in a systematic fashion and turn that into value.  These needs not only push for new and innovative capabilities in composable data management and analytical methods that can scale in an anytime anywhere fashion, but also require methods to bridge the gap between applications and compose such capabilities within solution architectures. <br/> In this short overview, we will show you a plethora of applications that are enabled by data science techniques and describe the process and cyberinfrastructure used within these projects to solve questions. <br/> We will also overview SDSC's AWESOME and SUAVE platforms for data management and visualization. Particularly, in this session, you will learn about: (1)the basis process of data science, (2) reference solution architectures for computational data science, (3) the data management challenges when deal with steaming data, (4) how social media datasets can be used within scienftific studies, (5) graph analysis at scale, (6) effectively applying basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods to survey data, (7) examples for visualization of datasets through various end user platforms|

| **PM Session <br/><br/> 11:15 - 2:00 PM**<br/><br/> *15 min- Break will be based on instructor*| **Performance Tuning** <br/> _Bob Sinkovits, Director for Scientific Computing Applications, SDSC_ <br/> This session is targeted at attendees who both do their own code development and need their calculations to finish as quickly as possible. We&#39;ll cover the effective use of cache, loop-level optimizations, force reductions, optimizing compilers and their limitations, short-circuiting, time-space tradeoffs and more. Exercises will be done mostly in C, but emphasis will be on general techniques that can be applied in any language.  | **Information Visualization**<br/>  _Amit Chourasia, Senior Visualizaton Scientist, SDSC_ <br/> This tutorial will provide a ground up understanding of information visualization concepts and how they can be leveraged to select and use effective visual idioms for different data types such spreadsheet data, geospatial, graph, etc.). Attendees will go through a set of hands on exercises to create designs, decode and fix problems in existing visualization. Practical guidelines for visualization will be discussed as well.|

|**AM Session <br/> <br/>8 AM- 10:45 AM** <br/><br/>*15 min- Break will be based on instructor* | **GPU Computing and Programming** <br/> _Andreas Goetz, Research Scientist and Principal Investigator, SDSC_ <br/> This session provides an introduction to massively parallel computing with graphics processing units (GPUs). The use of GPUs is becoming increasingly popular across all scientific domains since GPUs can significantly accelerate time to solution for many computational tasks. Participants will be introduced to essential background of the GPU chip architecture and will learn how to program GPUs via the use of libraries, OpenACC compiler directives, and CUDA programming. The session will incorporate hands-on exercises for participants to acquire the skills to use and develop GPU aware applications. | **Scalable Machine Learning** <br/> _Mai Nguyen, Lead for Data Analytics, SDSC_ <br/> _Paul Rodriguez, Research Analyst, SDSC_ <br/> Machine learning is an integral part of knowledge discovery in a wide variety of applications. From scientific domains to social media analytics, the data that needs to be analyzed has become massive and complex. This session provides an introduction to approaches that can be used to perform machine learning at scale. Tools and procedures for executing machine learning techniques on HPC will be presented. Spark will also be covered. In particular, we will use Spark's machine learning library, MLlib, to demonstrate how distributed computing can be used to provide scalable machine learning. Please note: Knowledge of fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques is required. (See description for Machine Learning Overview.) |

An overview of the common MPI routines that are useful for beginner MPI programmers, including MPI environment set up, point-to-point communications, and collective communications routines will be provided. Simple examples illustrating distributed memory computing, with the use of common MPI routines, will be covered. The OpenMP section will provide an overview of constructs and directives for specifying parallel regions, work sharing, synchronization and data scope. Simple examples will be used to illustrate the use of OpenMP shared-memory programming model, and important run time environment variables Hands on exercises for both MPI and OpenMP will be done in C and FORTRAN. | **Deep Learning** <br/>  _Mai Nguyen, Lead for Data Analytics, SDSC_ <br/> _Paul Rodriguez, Research Analyst, SDSC_ <br/> Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, has seen tremendous growth and success in the past few years.  Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance across many domains, including image classification, speech recognition, and biomedical applications. Deep learning makes use of models that are composed of many layers of interconnected processing units.  The many layers allow for a deep network to learn representations of data at multiple and increasingly complex and task-specific levels of abstraction, leading to automatic feature learning and excellent prediction performance.  This session provides an introduction to deep learning concepts and approaches.  Case studies utilizing deep learning will be presented, and hands-on exercises will be covered using Keras.  Please note:  Knowledge of fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques is required. |
