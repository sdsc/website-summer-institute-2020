## SDSC Summer Institute Code of Conduct

All SDSC Summer Insitute attendees are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all attendees to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

### The Quick Version

SDSC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Summer Institute venue, including talks, social events, Twitter and other online media. Summer Institute participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Summer Institute without a refund at the discretion of the Summer Institute organisers.

### The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Attendees asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Robert Sinkovits or Susan Rathbun or the [UC San Diego Office for the prevention of harassment & discrimination](http://ophd.ucsd.edu/).

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Summer Institute organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Summer Institute with no refund.

We expect participants to follow these guidelines at any SDSC Summer Institute related event.
